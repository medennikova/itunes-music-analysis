    "# 01. Machine Learning for music playlists: Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first post in a series of posts devoted to building music playlists with Scikit-Learn tools.   \n",
    "This notebook covers data gathering and preparation and cleaning of the datasets I'm going to use in my analysis.\n",
    "For the overview of this analysis, its goals, methods, and installation notes please go to [00_Overview](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/00_Overview.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contents of the notebook\n",

    "## Machine Learning Intro\n",
    "In this analysis I'm interested in three classes of music (\"cycling\", \"ballet\", \"yoga\") and I want to find tracks in my iTunes music library that fit these classes. This is a multiclass classification problem. Classification is the task of predicting the value of a categorical variable given some input variables (the features). \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve that problem I use *supervised machine learning classification algorithms*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning is about creating models from data: a model learns from training data (data with class labels), and can be used to predict the result of test data (data without class labels). Thus the task of supervised learning is to construct an estimator which is able to predict the label of an object given the set of features. One can also think of classification as a function estimation problem where the function that we want to estimate separates the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "One of the main goals of this analysis is to explore the basics of Scikit-Learn tools. **[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)** is a popular Python package designed to give access to well-known machine learning algorithms within Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn is built upon Python's **[NumPy (Numerical Python)](http://www.numpy.org/)** and **[SciPy (Scientific Python)](http://scipy.org/)** libraries, which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also use **[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)** library in my analysis. Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures. It is a fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hero and the foundation of my analysis is the **[Echo Nest API](http://the.echonest.com/)**, which provides broad and deep data on millions of artists and songs. **[Pyechonest](https://github.com/echonest/pyechonest)** is an open source Python library for the Echo Nest API that I use in this analysis. To use The Echo Nest API, an API key is required. More about the API key [here](http://developer.echonest.com/raw_tutorials/register.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis I use the following track attributes, which are available through the Echo Nest API:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Acousticness** represents the likelihood a recording was created by solely acoustic means such as voice and acoustic instruments as opposed to electronically such as with synthesized, amplified, or effected instruments;\n",
    "* **Danceability** describes how suitable a track is for dancing using a number of musical elements (tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity);\n",
    "* **Energy** represents a perceptual measure of intensity and powerful activity released throughout the track;\n",
    "* **Instrumentalnes** is a measure of how likely a song is to be instrumental;\n",
    "* **Key** identifies the tonic triad, the chord, major or minor;\n",
    "* **Loudness** measures the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB);\n",
    "* **Mode** indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived;\n",
    "* **Speechiness** detects the presence of spoken words in a track;\n",
    "* **Tempo** is the speed or pace of a given piece (in beats per minute);\n",
    "* **Time signature** specifies how many beats are in each bar (or measure);\n",
    "* **Valence** describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g., happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n",

    "## Data preparation\n",
    "In the analysis I use two datasets:\n",
    "1. iTunes music library serves me as a *test dataset*, or non-labeled data;\n",
    "2. For the *training dataset* I made a csv file ('./labeled_tracks.csv') with hand picked tracks outside of my iTunes library. I labeled each track with one of the three classes: \"cycling\", \"yoga\", \"ballet\". \n",
    "\n",
    "iTunes library files track the media in iTunes. The iTunes library file, a file called iTunes Music Library.xml, is created automatically when you launch iTunes. 'iTunes Music Library.xml' contains information that's stored in the iTunes database of the songs in the library. On Mac OS X, it can be found in the directory 'Users/username/Music/iTunes'. More information about iTunes library files can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201610).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the analysis I use pandas DataFrame (DF) data structure, which one can think of as an Excel-like table of values. DataFrames have various methods that can be called to easily learn about the data contained in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To store data and results of my computations I use **[HDF5](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-hdf5)** format. HDF5 allows to treat a local file as a hash and work directly with pandas DataFrames. Very cool. It's trivial to read and write from this file using Pandas. "
